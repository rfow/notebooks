    "Having an accurate, timely indicator of copper demand can be particularly useful for decision making/risk management purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Though there are no universally accepted copper demand series, commodity consultant Wood Mackenzie’s (WM) refined copper demand numbers are well-respected. Updates are dependent upon the release of their reports and it’s not always clear how quickly the latest updates are factored in to their own forecasts, how those forecasts have evolved, as well as how the forecasts themselves have been implemented.\n",
    "\n",
    "Demand forecasts can be generated from historical demand data itself and potentially supplemented through exogenous variables over a number of layers (from micro to macro). Updates to these variables can be used to supplement overall demand expectations as well as quantify the most important eco/data metrics, among other things.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project can of course balloon in size, but the below highlights some of the ways we might approach the task.\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid getting overly bogged down in all the detailed decisions, there won't be a comment for every code line, but questions on any specifics are always welcome."

    "The WM data we have is yearly (providing data from 1976-2040). We do however have a public monthly indicator for copper demand from the ICSG (data from Aug 2004 to April 2019) which is available through Wind. ICSG data is also split into 10 countries/regions on a monthly basis as well, which would be useful for more granular analyses. ICSG public data has a delay of around three months.\n",
    "\n",
    "Seasonality of ICSG can therefore be applied to WM data. We could just use ICSG data directly of course, but WM tends to be more widely recognised. In a more detailed project, we might investigate differences in WM and ICSG demand accounting as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "We could either apply overall seasonal trends to each year or apply the percentage contribution of each month to each year. The former would likely lose too much granularity, although with the latter the limitation is that the monthly weights could highlight inaccuracies or differences in methodologies. Either way, the result would be far better than any blind interpolation and we’ll go for the latter."
